`!track start "item1" {quantity1} "item2" {quantity2}` 
This command will track the specified items until they reach a specified amount. You can track multiple items with one command. Make 
sure to surround the item name with "". The command will first check to find the barter stall which contains exactly 3 sticks. So,
move the sticks to whichever stall you want to track. The command will also print out a task ID, which can be used to stop tracking

`!track stop {taskID}`
This command will stop the tracking of a given task. The taskID is recieved at the end of the start command.

`!track all "item1" {quantity1} "item2" {quantity2}`

`!track refined {item} {tier}`
This command will track all the needed resources to create the refined materials of a certain item of a certain tier. The items that 
are allowed are: cloth, ingots, planks, bricks, leather, journals. For example, if you want to track the materials to gather the 
25 T5 refined planks for the T6 claim upgrade, you would type `!track refined planks 6`. This command tracks from all barter stalls in a claim,
rather than a single barter stall.
