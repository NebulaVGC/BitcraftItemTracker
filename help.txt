Welcome to the item tracking bot! Please use these commands to aid you on your journey in Bitcraft.

`/track stop {taskID}`
This command will stop the tracking of a given task. The taskID is recieved at the end of the start command.

`/track refined {item} {tier}`
This command will track all the needed resources to create the refined materials of a certain item of a certain tier. The items that 
are allowed are: cloth, ingots, planks, bricks, leather, journals. For example, if you want to track the materials to gather the 
25 T5 refined planks for the T6 claim upgrade, you would type `/track refined planks 5`. This command tracks from all barter stalls in a claim,
rather than a single barter stall. Will also show who contributed to the barter stalls.
